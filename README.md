# 📘 Steam Table Calculator

A simple Python application that calculates steam table properties (specific volume and enthalpy) based on user-provided temperature or pressure, with automatic interpolation for non-tabulated values.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Input **Temperature (°C)** or **Pressure (kPa)** and auto-fill the other.
- Displays:
  - Specific Volume (`vf`, `vg`)
  - Specific Enthalpy (`hf`, `hg`)
- **Real-time interpolation** for intermediate values.
- **Show/Hide** full steam table data.
- **Reset** button to clear all fields.
- **Help → About** section for user guidance.
- **Input validation** and **early-stage warnings**.
- **Sleek layout** using `tkinter`.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
├── SteamTable.csv        # The data file containing steam table information
├── ui.py                 # Main Python GUI application
├── README.md             # Project documentation
├── icon.ico (optional)   # Custom window icon
```

---

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries:
  - `tkinter` (standard with Python)
  - `pandas`

Install pandas with:
```bash
pip install pandas
```

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/steam-table-calculator.git
   cd steam-table-calculator
   ```

2. Make sure you have `SteamTable.csv` in the same directory.

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python ui.py
   ```

---

## ⚡ How It Works

- If you input a **Temperature**, it calculates and locks the Pressure and properties.
- If you input a **Pressure**, it calculates and locks the Temperature and properties.
- The app uses **linear interpolation** when the exact value is not available.
- A limit of **100°C** and **101.42 kPa** is enforced to match available data.
